# Contextual-AI-Based-Search-Engine-with-GROQ
# This code snippet demonstrates the implementation of a contextual AI-based search engine utilizing the Groq library. Groq is a powerful tool for querying and extracting relevant information from various data sources. The purpose of this search engine is to provide detailed answers to user queries based on the context extracted from web search results. Let's break down the code and its functionality:

Imports and Environment Setup:

import os: Imports the operating system module, which is used for interacting with the operating system.
import time: Imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions.
from groq import Groq: Imports the Groq library, which enables querying and retrieving information from data sources.
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"]: Sets the environment variable GROQ_API_KEY with the provided API key. This key is necessary for accessing the Groq API.

Function Definition: generate_response_groq:

This function takes two parameters: relevant_text (context extracted from web search results) and query (user's query).
Constructs a GROQ query string combining the user's query and the relevant context extracted from web search results.
Uses the Groq client to generate a completion for the user's query.
The completion is generated using the llama3-8b-8192 model, indicating the specific language model used for generating responses.
Extracts the answer from the generated completion and returns it as the response.

Usage:

To use this function, simply call generate_response_groq(relevant_text, query), where relevant_text is the context extracted from web search results, and query is the user's query.
The function will return a detailed response based on the context and the user's query.

Contextual Understanding:

The search engine aims to provide answers that are contextually relevant to the user's query by utilizing the extracted context from web search results.
If the search engine cannot provide a definitive answer, it responds with "unsure about answer" without attempting to fabricate information.

# This code snippet demonstrates a powerful approach to building an AI-based search engine that leverages contextual understanding to provide detailed and relevant responses to user queries.
